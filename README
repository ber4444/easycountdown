As New Year's Eve is coming, here is a small OS X app that counts down to midnight.

The idea is that you set the desktop background to play a slideshow, and put this app on top. It has transparent background and can be moved around and zoomed by the standard Cmd+Shift+Plus/Minus way.

From the menu, you define a video (e.g. fireworks) which will be automatically played at midnight.
